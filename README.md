# AI-Predictive-Maintenance-PTV
This project predicts maintenance needs for public transport vehicles using AI/ML to reduce breakdowns, optimize schedules, and improve operational efficiency. Historical vehicle sensor data (temperature, vibration, RPM, pressure) is analyzed to detect potential failures and anomalies.
